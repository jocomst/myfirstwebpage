    <h3>Why Lumpia is one of my favorite foods</h3>
    <p id="main-text">I have a very <strong>strong</strong> connection to filipino food because I grew up around that culture and the food reminds me 
        of my childhood. When I was in elementary school, my grandma would often cook traditional filipino foods for us to eat.
        We would also go to parties where they would serve all types of cultural food. Lumpia was always a food that was tough to make but extremely rewarding to eat afterwards.

            <p>The Spanish came to the Philippines and ruled its islands by 1566 until 1899. Filipinos began using the Spanish sofrito of tomatoes, onions, and garlic cooked in oil for their dishes. Many cooking customs and techniques were adapted as well as various dishes.

                Since the Spanish ruled both Mexico and the Philippines, the two were inevitably connected and they transported various goods between the two colonies. 
                Spanish colonizers and friars in the 16th century brought with them produce from the New World such as chili peppers, 
                chocolate, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, pineapples, bell peppers, jicama, chayote, avocado, peanuts, annatto and the method of saut√©ing with garlic and onions. 
                Chili leaves are frequently used as a cooking green. The Mexicans received rice, sugarcane, tamarind, coconuts, and mangoes from the Philippine soil. <br><br>
                Hispanic dishes were eventually incorporated into Filipino cuisine with the more complex dishes usually being prepared for special occasions.
                 Some dishes such as arroz a la valenciana remain largely the same in the Filipino context. Some have been adapted or have come to take on a slightly or significantly different meaning. Arroz a la cubana served in the Philippines usually includes ground beef picadillo. Philippine longganisa despite its name is more akin to chorizo than Spanish longaniza (in Visayan regions, it is still known as chorizo). Morcon likely refers to a beef roulade dish, not the bulbous specialty Spanish sausage.</p>
